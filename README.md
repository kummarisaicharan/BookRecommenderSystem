# BookRecommenderSystem

The Project is based on Recommendation Systems on books . With the help of various techniques/methodologies I was able to successfully create a recommender system for the users based on their previous viewing habits and based on their ratings.

I have used collaborative filtering method based on Pearson correlation coefficient for the Recommender System.

## Why Recommender Systems ?
1. We tend to like things that are similar to other things we like
2. We tend to like things that are liked by similar people
3. These patterns can be used to make predictions to offer new things
4. Recommendation systems involve predicting users preferences for unseen items such as books 
5. Recommendation systems have become very popular with the increasing availability of millions of products online
6. Recommending relevant products increases the sales
